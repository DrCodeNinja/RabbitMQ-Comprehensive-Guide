## Prerequisites

Before installing RabbitMQ, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Erlang:** RabbitMQ requires Erlang to run. Ensure that you have a compatible version of Erlang installed.

## Installation

### Linux

#### Debian/Ubuntu

1. Update your package list:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

2. Install RabbitMQ server:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server -y
    ```

#### CentOS/RHEL

1. Enable the EPEL repository:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install epel-release -y
    ```

2. Install RabbitMQ server:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install rabbitmq-server -y
    ```

### macOS

1. Install RabbitMQ using Homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install rabbitmq
    ```

2. Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    brew services start rabbitmq
    ```

### Windows

1. Download the RabbitMQ installer from the [official website](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-windows.html).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Ensure that Erlang is installed, as RabbitMQ requires it to run.

## Configuration

After installing RabbitMQ, you can configure it using the configuration file located at `/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf` on Linux, or in the installation directory on macOS and Windows.

### Basic Configuration

1. **Enable Plugins:** Enable necessary plugins such as the management plugin.

    ```bash
    sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
    ```

2. **Set up a Virtual Host (vhost):**

    ```bash
    sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost /my_vhost
    ```

3. **Create a New User:**

    ```bash
    sudo rabbitmqctl add_user myuser mypassword
    ```

4. **Set Permissions for the User:**

    ```bash
    sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p /my_vhost myuser ".*" ".*" ".*"
    ```

## Starting RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ can be started as a service or manually depending on your operating system.

### Linux

```bash
sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
